/*
Delegation is a design pattern that enables a class or structure to hand off (or delegate)
some of its responsibilities to an instance of another type.
This design pattern is implemented by defining a protocol that encapsulates the delegated responsibilities,
such that a conforming type (known as a delegate) is guaranteed to provide the functionality that has been delegated.
Delegation can be used to respond to a particular action,
or to retrieve data from an external source without needing to know the underlying type of that source.
